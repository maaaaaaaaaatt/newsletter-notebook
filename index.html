      <h1>“When you love you see a future according to your dreams.” - James Salter, The Art of Fiction No. 13</h1>
      <h2>Nov. 16, 2021</h2>

      <p>James Salter is a consummate storyteller. His manners are precise and elegant; he has a splendid New York
         accent;
         he runs his hands through his gray hair and laughs boyishly. At sixty-seven he has the fitness of an
         ex-military
         man. He tells anecdotes easily, dramatically, but he also carries an aura of reserve about him. There is a
         privacy
         one doesn’t breach.</p>

      <p>Salter was born in 1925 and raised in New York City. He graduated from West Point in 1945 and was commissioned
         in
         the U.S. Army Air Force as a pilot. He served for twelve years in the Pacific, the United States, Europe, and
         Korea, where he flew over one hundred combat missions as a fighter pilot. He resigned from the Air Force after
         his
         first novel came out in 1957, and settled in Grandview on the Hudson, just north of New York City. He has
         earned
         his living as a writer ever since. He has three grown children, a son and two daughters, by a previous
         marriage.
         He lives with the writer Kay Eldredge and their eight-year-old son, Theo. They divide their time between Aspen,
         Colorado and Bridgehampton, Long Island.</p>

      <p>Salter has published five novels: The Hunters (1957), The Arm of Flesh (1961), A
         Sport and a Pastime (1967),
         Light
         Years (1975), and Solo Faces (1979). He received an award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and
         Letters in 1982. Five of his stories have appeared in O. Henry collections and one in the Best American Short
         Stories. His collection Dusk & Other Stories (1988) received the PEN/Faulkner Award.</p>

      <p>It rained continuously during the four days I visited Bridgehampton in August of 1992, but I scarcely
         noticed
         the
         weather, so content was I to sit at the dining room table asking questions and listening to Salter’s
         carefully
         considered answers. Even on gray days the traditional, cedar-shingled two-floor house with its many French
         doors
         and windows seemed bathed in light. We drank ice tea by day, and one exquisitely made martini each night
         (Salter
         at one point estimated that he has had eighty-seven hundred martinis in his life). Afterward, company came
         for
         dinner; many bottles of wine were consumed; the interviewer wandered off to examine the framed menus on the
         wall,
         the etching of two bathers by André de Segonzac, the miniature painting by Sheridan Lord of the landscape
         near
         the
         house.</p>

      <p>Salter writes in a study on the second floor, a small, airy room with a peaked ceiling and a half-moon
         window.
         His
         desk is a large wooden country-trestle table made of old pine. Everywhere there are telltale signs of the
         memoir
         he has been working on for the past years—envelopes that have been scrawled on, scraps of paper that have
         been
         entirely covered with his minute handwriting. On the morning that I was left alone in the study I found
         well-thumbed copies of Nabokov’s Speak, Memory and Isak Dinesen’s Out of Africa resting on a map of France
         with
         places circled and marked. I discovered an aeronautical chart, a sheaf of twelve extremely detailed pages of
         notes
         in red, blue, and black ink, a journal from 1955 with the sentence written across the front: “Every year
         seems
         the
         most terrible.” On the small wooden table next to the desk lay a group of cahiers, little soft-covered
         gray-numbered notebooks, each containing a possible chapter of the memoir. These homemade workbooks are

         <blockquote>Life passes into pages if it passes into anything, and then revised again until the prose shimmers,
            radiant and indestructible.</blockquote>
         dense
         with
         notes—the author’s instructions to himself, quotations from other writers, entries that have been
         color-coded
         for
         the place where they might be used. “Life passes into pages if it passes into anything,” Salter has written,
         and
         to read through these notes is to reconfirm what one knew all along: how meticulously each of his pages is
         written, how scrupulously each of his chapters constructed. Everything is checked and rechecked, written and
         revised and then revised again until the prose shimmers, radiant and indestructible.</p>
      <p> Coming down the stairs past the photograph of Isaac Babel I grew once more wildly excited about Salter’s
         work-in-progress. He demurs: “Hope but not enthusiasm is the proper state for the writer.”</p>

      <p>“Above all, it must be compelling,” James Salter told the Paris Review in 1993 when asked about his idea of the
         short story. “You’re sitting around the campfire of literature, so to speak, and various voices speak up out of
         the dark and begin talking. With some, your mind wanders or you doze off, but with others you are held by every
         word. The first line, the first sentence, the first paragraph, all have to compel you.” Long before I ever read
         those remarks by Salter, I’d already come under the influence of his short stories and,
         in particular, his crystalline opening paragraphs.</p>
